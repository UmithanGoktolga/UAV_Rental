# uav-rental
Here is detailed explanations for Models, Views and Forms:

--Views.py--

Imports:

Various utility functions and classes are imported from Django and local modules to facilitate operations.

home_page(request):

Renders the home page, showing all the UAVs available.
Sends whether the user is authenticated as part of the context to the template.

register_page(request: HttpRequest):

Handles user registration.
If a POST request is received, the function tries to fetch details from the form to create a new user.
If the email is already taken, an error message is displayed.
Otherwise, a new user is saved in the database.

login_page(request):

Handles user login.
If a POST request is received, the function tries to authenticate the user based on the provided email and password.
If the user is found and the password is correct, the user is logged in.
Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

logout_page(request):

Logs the user out and redirects them to the home page.

uav_form(request, id=0):

A dual-purpose view for adding a new UAV or editing an existing UAV.
If the id is 0, it means a new UAV is being added. Otherwise, an existing UAV with that id is being edited.
If the request method is GET, it renders the UAV form. For a POST request, it processes the submitted form data.

uav_delete(request, id):

Deletes a UAV based on its id.

rental_form(request, id=0):

Similar to uav_form, but for rentals.
For a POST request, it checks the validity of the form, checks if the UAV is available, and then saves the rental.

rental_delete(request, id):

Allows a user to delete a rental.
It first checks if the user trying to delete the rental is the same user who created the rental. If not, an error message is displayed.
If the user is authorized, the rental is deleted.

rentals_list(request):

Fetches and displays all rentals in a list format.

Throughout the views:

print statements are used for debugging purposes, showing specific pieces of information in the console.
messages is a Django utility that helps in displaying one-time notifications to the user.
The redirect function is used to navigate to different endpoints based on the outcome of operations.
The render function is used to serve HTML templates, often with a context that contains dynamic data to be rendered.
In summary, this views.py file handles the primary operations related to UAVs and rentals – including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) – as well as user registration and authentication.


--Models.py--



Imports:

models from django.db is the main module to define ORM-based database models in Django.
AbstractBaseUser is a core user authentication model provided by Django.

CAT_CHOICES:

A tuple containing choices for categories. It will be used as choices for the Category model's title field.

User(AbstractBaseUser):

A custom user model derived from Django's AbstractBaseUser.
name: Stores the user's first name.
surname: Stores the user's last name.
email: A unique field storing the user's email address. Also, the primary identifier for authentication instead of the usual username.
phone: To store the user's phone number.
password: To store the user's hashed password.
last_login: A nullable field to store the timestamp of the user's last login.
USERNAME_FIELD: This informs Django that email is the field used for user authentication.

Category(models.Model):

Represents categories for UAVs.
title: This field represents the title of the category and is restricted to choices defined in CAT_CHOICES. It defaults to 'cat1'.

UAV(models.Model):

Represents the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) model.
brand: The brand of the UAV.
model: The model name/number of the UAV.
weight: The weight of the UAV.
category: A foreign key relation to the Category model. This signifies the category of the UAV.
is_available: A boolean field to check if the UAV is available for rent.
__str__: Returns a string representation of the UAV.

Rental(models.Model):

Represents the rental details of a UAV by a user.
uav: A foreign key relation to the UAV model.
user: A foreign key relation to the User model. It represents the user who has rented the UAV.
start_date and end_date: DateTime fields indicating the rental period.
is_uav_available(): A method that checks if a UAV is available for rent. It does this by finding any existing rentals of the UAV that overlap with the current rental period. If such rentals exist, the UAV is considered unavailable.
Meta: This inner class specifies model-specific options. The ordering option ensures that queries retrieving rentals are ordered by the start_date in descending order.
__str__: Provides a human-readable representation of the Rental instance.

The models defined in this file enable you to:

Create a custom user system with attributes like name, surname, email, etc.
Categorize UAVs.
Keep a record of all the UAVs along with their details and availability status.
Record all rentals of UAVs, the user renting them, and the rental period.
The relationships between models (like ForeignKey between UAV and Category) allow you to associate UAVs with specific categories and users with specific rentals.


--Forms.py--

Imports:

forms from django: This provides the base classes and functionalities needed to define Django forms.
models: This imports all the models you've defined in your models.py file.

UAVForm:

This is a Django ModelForm for the UAV model. ModelForms are a way to generate Django forms directly from Django models. They ease the creation process by automatically generating form fields from the model fields.

Meta class: Contains meta data about the form.
model: The model the form is associated with (in this case, models.UAV).
fields: The model fields that should be included in the form.
labels: Custom labels for each field. This helps in providing more readable or user-friendly labels for form fields.

RentalForm:

This form represents the rental process where a user rents a UAV.

Meta class:

model: Associated with the models.Rental model.
fields: Specifies which fields are included in the form.
labels: Custom labels for the fields.
widgets: These are used to customize how certain form fields should be rendered in the template. For instance, the start_date and end_date are being rendered using a DateTimeInput widget that's specifically set to a datetime-local input type, providing a user-friendly date-time picker in supporting browsers.

clean method:
This is an essential method for any Django form when you need to perform custom validation on the form data.

After fetching the cleaned data:

It checks if the start_date is not greater than or equal to the end_date. If it is, it raises a validation error, ensuring that a rental period has a logical start and end time.

It then checks for overlapping rentals. It's ensuring that the same UAV isn't rented out by two different users at overlapping times. If there's an overlap, a validation error is raised.

The debug print statements are for helping in development, giving insights on what's being checked during the validation.

In essence, forms.py defines the structure and validation of the forms used in the application. ModelForms, make it straightforward to create forms based on the data models of the application. They ensure that data adheres to the constraints and logic of your business rules, providing a secure and coherent user experience.
